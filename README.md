# RetinaNet Model Deployment on i.MX8+ Device

## Overview
This project, a capstone endeavor by graduate students from the Engineering Artificial Intelligence program at CMU, focuses on the quantization and deployment of the RetinaNet model on the i.MX8+ device. The project aims to enhance the capabilities of the i.MX8+ device in handling advanced AI models, with a particular focus on applications in global health scenarios.

## Project Description
Global Health Labs, Inc. (GH Labs) is a nonprofit organization based in Bellevue, Washington, USA, that develops innovative technologies to address unmet healthcare needs, especially in low- and middle-income countries. There is a critical healthcare disparity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly concerning cervical cancer screening. These communities often face limited access to advanced medical technology, which leads to late detection and intervention for pre-cancerous lesions.

GH Labs has been working with partners to develop and deploy a machine learning-based cervical cancer screening system for low- and middle-income countries such as Rwanda, Zambia, Malawi, Senegal, and India. This system currently runs on Samsung phones; however, these phones have a short shelf life of about 9 to 12 months and need to be changed or updated frequently. These changes require multiple model adaptations that increase their costs and render them unsuitable for long-term deployment in resource-constrained environments.

The purpose of this project is to further the development and optimization of the Automated Visual Examination (AVE) system for cervical cancer detection by transitioning the AVE system from its current Android-based implementation to a more widely deployable, standalone medical device with a longer shelf life of 5 to 10 years. This product will provide a cost-effective, long-lasting solution to cervical cancer screening and ensure easy accessibility and improved healthcare outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.
